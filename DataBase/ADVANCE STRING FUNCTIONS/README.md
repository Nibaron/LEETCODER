# [196. Delete Duplicate Emails](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-duplicate-emails/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50)

Table: `Person`

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| email       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains an email. The emails will not contain uppercase letters.
```

Write a solution to** delete**  all duplicate emails, keeping only one unique email with the smallest `id`.

For SQL users, please note that you are supposed to write a `DELETE` statement and not a `SELECT` one.

For Pandas users, please note that you are supposed to modify `Person` in place.

After running your script, the answer shown is the `Person` table. The driver will first compile and run your piece of code and then show the `Person` table. The final order of the `Person` table **does not matter** .

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:** 

```
Input: 
Person table:
+----+------------------+
| id | email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com |
+----+------------------+
Output: 
+----+------------------+
| id | email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
+----+------------------+
Explanation: john@example.com is repeated two times. We keep the row with the smallest Id = 1.
```
> Explanation
```
/*
SELECT *
FROM Person p1, Person p2
WHERE p1.Email = p2.Email AND
p1.Id > p2.Id

+----+------------------+----+------------------+
| id | email            | id | email            |
+----+------------------+----+------------------+
| 3  | john@example.com | 1  | john@example.com |
+----+------------------+----+------------------+

for delete P1...
column 1 and 2 [id, email] of p1 X p2 will be deleted 

DELETE Statement:

DELETE p1: This specifies that rows from the table Person (aliased as p1) will be deleted based on the conditions specified in the WHERE clause.
*/
```

> My Code
```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
DELETE p2
FROM Person p1 INNER JOIN Person p2
WHERE p1.email = p2.email
AND p1.id < p2.id;

-- we join two table where p2 is greater id mail , 
-- so we delete it
```
