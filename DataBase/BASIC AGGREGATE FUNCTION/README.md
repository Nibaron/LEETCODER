| movie          | varchar  |
| description    | varchar  |
| rating         | float    |
+----------------+----------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row contains information about the name of a movie, its genre, and its rating.
rating is a 2 decimal places float in the range [0, 10]
```

Write a solution to report the movies with an odd-numbered ID and a description that is not `"boring"`.

Return the result table ordered by `rating` **in descending order** .

Theresult format is in the following example.

**Example 1:** 

```
Input: 
Cinema table:
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
| id | movie      | description | rating |
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
| 1  | War        | great 3D    | 8.9    |

Explanation: 
We have three movies with odd-numbered IDs: 1, 3, and 5. The movie with ID = 3 is boring so we do not include it in the answer.

# Write your MySQL query statement below

SUM(amount)  AS trans_total_amount,

SUM(IF(state='approved',amount,0))  as approved_total_amount

FROM Transactions

GROUP  BY  month, country;
```
REMEMBER,
No, we cannot use `COUNT` instead of `SUM` in this context. The reason is that `COUNT` counts the number of non-null values in a column, while `SUM` adds up the numerical values in a column.

In the expression `SUM(state = 'approved')`, the condition `state = 'approved'` evaluates to either `1` (true) or `0` (false) for each row. So, `SUM(state = 'approved')` effectively counts the number of rows where the condition is true, which is the same as counting the occurrences of the `'approved'` state.

However, if you use `COUNT(state = 'approved')`, it will count the number of non-null values in the `state = 'approved'` column. Since the `COUNT` function does not treat boolean values as numerical values to be added up, it will not yield the desired result of counting the occurrences of the `'approved'` state.

Therefore, in this context, using `SUM` is the correct choice to count the occurrences of the `'approved'` state.

| device_id    | int     |
| event_date   | date    |

+--------------+---------+
(player_id, event_date) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some games.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on someday using some device.
```

Write asolutionto report the **fraction**  of players that logged in again on the day after the day they first logged in, **rounded to 2 decimal places** . In other words, you need to count the number of players that logged in for at least two consecutive days starting from their first login date, then divide that number by the total number of players.

Theresult format is in the following example.

**Example 1:** 

```
Input: 
Activity table:
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 5            |

Output: 
+-----------+
| fraction  |
+-----------+

Explanation: 
Only the player with id 1 logged back in after the first day he had logged in so the answer is 1/3 = 0.33
